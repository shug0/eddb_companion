# EDDB Companion

**EDDB** is a website about *systems*, *stations*, *commodities* and *trade routes* in [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/).

**EDDB Companion** is a [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) application for accessing datas from EDDB.io on your phone.

##How ?
EDDB.io has not yet a public **REST API** so for now so the app download the resume JSON on [eddb.io/api](https://eddb.io/api) and store it on the mobile of the users.
